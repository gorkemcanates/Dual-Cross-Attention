We propose Dual Cross-Attention (DCA), a simple yet effective attention module that is able to enhance skip-connections in U-Net-based architectures for medical image segmentation. Our proposed module addresses the semantic gap between encoder and decoder features by sequentially capturing channel and spatial dependencies across multi-scale encoder features.
